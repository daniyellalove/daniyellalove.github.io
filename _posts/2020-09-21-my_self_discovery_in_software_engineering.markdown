Looking for a career change can be daunting. The very first time I thought about the idea, I was apprehensive but also very excited to see what my options were. So when the opportunity arrived I was ready to jump in! Why software engineering you say? Since primary school, coding had always peaked my interest. From the mere instances of Wade helping Kim possible with his cool tech or even by accidentally clicking the wrong (or should I say right) buttons on my computer leading me to the discovery of code. I always kept it in my line of sight and thought to myself, this is a career that I want to pursue and eventually expound on. When my time came to learn about code in middle school, I was so excited. I jumped onto the train of Black Girls Code and built my own game with the help of my trusty instructors. It was the tip of the iceberg but a step in the right direction. After graduating school, I felt stuck in a job that I knew could not be the end for me. I would ask myself why I didn’t go in the direction I originally planned but it also scared me to think it was still a viable option. I finally gathered up the courage to start searching for the path I wanted to go in. Through searching, I found bootcamps and Flatiron School. I knew that learning full stack web development with 1 on 1 mentorship and career services was hard to come by so I naturally went with Flatiron. These motivators would provide the best driving force I would need to succeed in this industry. As I’m given the opportunity to learn everyday, I am reminded of why I chose this field and why I will keep pursuing it to reach my goals in the future. I am forever eager to learn and ready to be part of something bigger in the tech world. I will work towards becoming the best software engineer I can be.
